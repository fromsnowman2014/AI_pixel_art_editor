AI Image Generation Feature Implementation Plan

    Based on the analysis of DEVELOPMENT_AI_IMAGE_GEN.md and the current codebase, I'll create a comprehensive plan to implement, 
    verify, improve, and test the AI generation functionality.

    Current Status Analysis

    ✅ Backend Infrastructure: Already implemented
    - OpenAI service with DALL-E 3/2 integration  
    - AI routes (/api/ai/generate, /api/ai/variations)
    - Image processing pipeline with quantization
    - Health check endpoint with service monitoring
    - Rate limiting and authentication middleware

    ✅ Frontend Infrastructure: Partially implemented
    - API client with AI generation methods
    - Project panel UI with AI generation form
    - Backend API URL configuration

    ❌ Missing Components:
    - Frontend-backend integration (handleAiGenerate is stubbed)
    - Health check validation before AI generation
    - Canvas integration for placing generated images
    - Error handling and user feedback
    - Comprehensive testing coverage

    Implementation Plan

    Phase 1: Backend Verification & Enhancement (30 mins)

    1. Health Check Enhancement
      - Add OpenAI API key validation to /health endpoint
      - Implement Redis connectivity verification
      - Add service status indicators per DEVELOPMENT_AI_IMAGE_GEN.md
    2. Environment Configuration
      - Verify all required environment variables
      - Add missing dependencies (ioredis if needed)
      - Validate Railway deployment configuration
    3. API Route Testing
      - Test /api/ai/generate endpoint functionality
      - Validate image processing pipeline
      - Verify error handling and response formats

    Phase 2: Frontend Integration (45 mins)

    1. AI Generation Implementation
      - Replace stubbed handleAiGenerate with actual API calls
      - Add health check validation before generation
      - Implement prompt optimization and validation
    2. Canvas Integration
      - Add frame creation logic for AI-generated images
      - Implement image loading and placement
      - Ensure pixel-perfect rendering with CSS image-rendering
    3. User Experience
      - Add proper loading states and progress indicators
      - Implement error handling with user-friendly messages
      - Add success feedback and result preview

    Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance (30 mins)

    1. Unit Testing
      - Test prompt building and validation
      - Test API client methods
      - Test canvas integration functions
    2. Integration Testing
      - End-to-end AI generation workflow
      - Health check → generation → canvas placement
      - Error scenarios and edge cases
    3. Manual Testing
      - Test with various prompts and settings
      - Verify palette quantization
      - Test frame creation and management

    Phase 4: Performance & Optimization (15 mins)

    1. Performance Validation
      - Verify generation time targets (<10 seconds)
      - Test image processing pipeline efficiency
      - Validate memory usage and cleanup
    2. Documentation
      - Create implementation documentation
      - Document API usage patterns
      - Add troubleshooting guide

    Deliverables

    1. Working AI Generation: Full pipeline from prompt to canvas
    2. Comprehensive Tests: Unit, integration, and manual test suites
    3. Implementation Documentation: Saved as plan document
    4. Error Handling: Robust error scenarios coverage
    5. Performance Validation: Meeting specified targets

    Success Criteria

    - AI generation works end-to-end (prompt → image → canvas)
    - Health check validates OpenAI key availability
    - Generated images respect color limits and canvas dimensions
    - Proper error handling for all failure scenarios
    - All tests pass with >90% coverage for AI features
    - Performance targets met (<10 seconds total time)

    This plan addresses all requirements from DEVELOPMENT_AI_IMAGE_GEN.md while building on the existing robust backend infrastructure.
