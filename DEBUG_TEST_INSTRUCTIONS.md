# Debug Test Instructions

## Enable Debug Mode

1. **Open browser console** on https://ai-pixel-art-editor.vercel.app
2. **Run this command** to enable debug logging:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('pixelbuddy-debug', 'true')
   ```
3. **Refresh the page** to activate debug mode
4. **Start drawing** and check console logs

## Test Procedure

1. Click "Start Creating (Local Mode)"
2. Select pencil tool and any color
3. Click on canvas to draw pixels
4. **Expected behavior**: Drawing should appear IMMEDIATELY
5. **Check console logs** for:
   - `DRAW_UPDATE_COMPLETE` - Drawing operation completed
   - `FORCE_RERENDER` or `RENDER_START` - Canvas re-render triggered
   - `RENDER_COMPLETE` - Canvas successfully rendered

## Key Debug Logs to Watch

### ✅ Success Pattern:
```
[timestamp] 🎨 PixelCanvas [DRAW_UPDATE_COMPLETE]: updateCanvasData called successfully
[timestamp] 🎨 PixelCanvas [RENDER_START]: Canvas render effect triggered
[timestamp] 🎨 PixelCanvas [RENDER_COMPLETE]: Canvas rendered successfully
```

### ❌ Failure Pattern:
```
[timestamp] 🎨 PixelCanvas [DRAW_UPDATE_COMPLETE]: updateCanvasData called successfully
[timestamp] 🎨 PixelCanvas [DRAW_FOLLOWUP_CHECK]: Checking if component re-rendered after draw
// Missing RENDER_START = Problem!
```

## Expected Fix Result

**Before Fix**: Drawing → No immediate visual feedback → Shows after page refresh
**After Fix**: Drawing → Immediate visual feedback → Works correctly

## If Still Not Working

Check these specific log entries:
1. `canvasDataId` changes after drawing
2. `RENDER_START` triggered immediately after `DRAW_UPDATE_COMPLETE`
3. `RENDER_VERIFICATION` shows actual rendered pixels > 0

## Manual Test Steps

1. Draw a single pixel
2. Verify it appears immediately (no refresh needed)  
3. Draw multiple pixels in sequence
4. Verify all appear in real-time
5. Change tools/colors and verify functionality

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Drawing operations appear immediately
- ✅ No need to refresh page to see changes
- ✅ Console shows proper render cycle
- ✅ Canvas data and visual state stay synchronized
